Welcome to the FinOps toolkit! As an open-source initiative, our success hinges on the collective effort of the community. Your contributions play a vital role in enhancing and expanding the toolkit's capabilities, making it more valuable and effective.

There are several ways you can contribute to the FinOps toolkit:

1. üêõ **Working on existing bugs:** You can assist by identifying and addressing existing bugs listed in our repository. 
2. üõ†Ô∏è  **Providing suggestions for new features or improvements:** If you're not comfortable with coding, you can still contribute by suggesting new features or improvements for our tools.
3. üí° **Proposing a new tool:** If you've developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps toolkit, you can submit a proposal for consideration.
4. üëÄ **Reviewing pull requests:** Code reviews are a critical aspect of maintaining code quality and ensuring the reliability and functionality of the project. By reviewing existing pull requests (PRs) suggested by community members, you can contribute significantly to the project's success without necessarily creating new code.
5. üí¨ **Answering questions:** Being actively involved in answering questions and providing assistance to community members is an invaluable contribution to the project.
6. üìö **Updating documentation:** Documentation serves as a crucial resource for users, developers, and contributors alike. Keeping documentation accurate, comprehensive, and up to date is essential for the success of the toolkit.


We appreciate your interest in contributing to the FinOps Toolkit project!

## üêõ Working on existing bugs

If you're eager to contribute but unsure where to begin, a great starting point is to review the list of existing feedback and identify issues that align with your skills and interests. 

1. Look through the list of [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues).
2. Assign yourself to the bug you want to work on.

If this is the first time you are working on the FinOps toolkit repository, make sure to review our [Get started wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/wiki#-get-started).

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggesting and owning a new feature, fixing an existing bug, or suggesting a change for an existing tool

### Submitting a new issue

If you have a new feature suggestion, identified a bug, or have ideas for improving existing tools, we encourage you to submit an issue. Your feedback helps us ensure that the toolkit meets the needs of its users. And if you're willing to take it a step further and contribute to implementing your suggestions, we welcome your contributions with open arms! 

To do that, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the [issues list](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/FinOpsToolkit/issues) and click on "New issue".
2. Choose the option that best describes your contribution (bug fix, change request, or feature request).
3. Check the box "Willing to fix" at the bottom of the page.
4. Submit your issue.

## üí° Proposing a new tool

If you have developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps toolkit, go to the issues list, click on "New issue" and select the "Propose a new tool" option. Please include as much information as possible about your tool and how it can benefit the FinOps community.

The FinOps toolkit governing board will review your proposal and reach out to you for further discussion.

<br>

## üëÄ **Reviewing pull requests**

Check the list of [open pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/pulls) and provide constructive feedback on code changes proposed by community members. Ensure that the code adheres to our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/wiki/Coding-guidelines), is well-documented, and follows best practices.

Offer suggestions for improving the quality of the code, such as optimizing performance, enhancing readability, and addressing potential edge cases or bugs.

Test the functionality of the code changes proposed in the PR to ensure they work as intended. This involves running tests, verifying edge cases, and checking for any unintended side effects.

When possible, try to suggest code changes using **Add a suggestion** to streamline the review process.
