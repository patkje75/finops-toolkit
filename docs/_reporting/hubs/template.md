This template creates a new **FinOps hub** instance.

FinOps hubs include:

- Data Lake storage to host cost data.
- Data Factory for data processing and orchestration.
- Key Vault for storing secrets.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
  _To use this template, you will need to create a Cost Management export that publishes cost data to the `msexports` container in the included storage account. See [Create a new hub](README.md#-create-a-new-hub) for details._

   _<sup>1. It is sufficient to assign hubs resources deployment permissions on the resource group scope.</sup>_<br/>
   _<sup>2. Creating a temporary Event Grid namespace is optional if the Event Grid resource provider is already registered for the subscription. If not, the template will create and delete a temporary Event Grid namespace, which will trigger automatic RP registration.</sup>_<br/>
   _<sup>3. Cost Management permissions must be assigned on the scope where you want to export your costs from.</sup>_<br/>
   _<sup>4. Blob data permissions are required to access exported cost data from Power BI or other client tools.</sup>_<br/>

2. The Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider must be registered in your subscription. See [Register a resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) for details.

## üéõÔ∏è Resources

The following resources are created in the target resource group during deployment.

Resources use the following naming convention: `<hubName>-<purpose>-<unique-suffix>`. Names are adjusted to account for length and character restrictions. The `<unique-suffix>` is used to ensure resource names are globally unique where required.

- `<hubName>store<unique-suffix>` storage account (Data Lake Storage Gen2)
  - Blob containers:
    - `msexports` ‚Äì Temporarily stores Cost Management exports.
    - `ingestion` ‚Äì Stores ingested data.
      <blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
        _In the future, we will use this container to stage external data outside of Cost Management._
      </blockquote>
    - `config` ‚Äì Stores hub metadata and configuration settings. Files:
      - `settings.json` ‚Äì Hub settings.
      - `schemas/focuscost_1.0.json` ‚Äì FOCUS 1.0 schema definition for parquet conversion.
      - `schemas/focuscost_1.0-preview(v1).json` ‚Äì FOCUS 1.0-preview schema definition for parquet conversion.
- `<hubName>-engine-<unique-suffix>` Data Factory instance
  - Pipelines:
    - `msexports_ExecuteETL` ‚Äì Queues the `msexports_ETL_ingestion` pipeline to account for Data Factory pipeline trigger limits.
    - `msexports_ETL_transform` ‚Äì Converts Cost Management exports into parquet and removes historical data duplicated in each day's export.
    - `config_ConfigureExports` ‚Äì Creates Cost Management exports for all scopes.
    - `config_BackfillData` ‚Äì Runs the backfill job for each month based on retention settings.
    - `config_RunBackfill` ‚Äì Creates and triggers exports for all defined scopes for the specified date range.
    - `config_ExportData` ‚Äì Gets a list of all Cost Management exports configured for this hub based on the scopes defined in settings.json, then runs each export using the config_RunExports pipeline.
    - `config_RunExports` ‚Äì Runs the specified Cost Management exports.
    - `msexports_ExecuteETL` ‚Äì Triggers the ingestion process for Cost Management exports to account for Data Factory pipeline trigger limits.
    - `msexports_ETL_transform` ‚Äì Converts Cost Management exports into parquet and removes historical data duplicated in each day's export.
  - Triggers:
    - `config_SettingsUpdated` ‚Äì Triggers the `config_ConfigureExports` pipeline when settings.json is updated.
    - `config_DailySchedule` ‚Äì Triggers the `config_RunExports` pipeline daily for the current month's cost data.
    - `config_MonthlySchedule` ‚Äì Triggers the `config_RunExports` pipeline monthly for the previous month's cost data.
    - `msexports_FileAdded` ‚Äì Triggers the `msexports_ExecuteETL` pipeline when Cost Management exports complete.
- `<hubName>-vault-<unique-suffix>` Key Vault instance
  - Secrets:
    - Data Factory system managed identity

In addition to the above, the following resources are created to automate the deployment process. The deployment scripts should be deleted automatically but please do not delete the managed identities as this may cause errors when upgrading to the next release.

- Managed identities:
  - `<storage>_blobManager` ([Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor)) ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file.
  - `<datafactory>_triggerManager` ([Data Factory Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor)) ‚Äì Stops triggers before deployment and starts them after deployment.
  - `<unique-suffix>_cleanup` ([EventGrid Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#eventgrid-contributor)) ‚Äì Deletes temporary EventGrid namespace used to register the EventGrid RP.
- Deployment scripts (automatically deleted after a successful deployment):
  - `<unique-suffix>_deleteEventGrid` ‚Äì Deletes temporary EventGrid namespace used to register the EventGrid RP.
  - `<datafactory>_deleteOldResources` ‚Äì Deletes unused resources from previous FinOps hubs deployments.
  - `<datafactory>_stopTriggers` ‚Äì Stops all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<datafactory>_startTriggers` ‚Äì Starts all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<storage>_uploadSettings` ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file using the blobManager identity.
