# 🛠️ Contributing to the FinOps toolkit

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the FinOps toolkit! Your time and effort is greatly appreciated, no matter how big or small the contribution is.

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## ❤️ Give feedback

Perhaps the simplest way to help make the FinOps toolkit better is simply to share your voice and let us know what's working well, what isn't, and how we can improve the toolkit to help you streamline your FinOps efforts. We use a [quick, 7-question survey](https://aka.ms/ftk/feedback) to prioritize our releases. Let us know what you think and we'll incorporate that into the next release.

<br>

## 🙋‍♀️ Asking questions

Have a question? Please ask in [Discussions](../../discussions). Avoid asking questions in issues to keep issues clean and focused on product improvements. If not sure, start a discussion and create an issue based on that discussion later, if needed.

<br>

## ℹ️ Suggesting features and reporting bugs

If you have an idea or notice a bug, [search open issues](../../issues) to see if an issue already exists.

If you find your exact issue, comment on the issue to add more context and vote it up (👍) or down (👎) instead of using "+1" comments ([about reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)). The more info you can provide, the more likely someone will be able to resolve the issue.

If you don't find your issue, [create a new issue](../../issues/new/choose) per problem or feature request (don't group them together).

<br>

## 👀 Reviewing code changes

If you want to help out with code, but aren't quite ready to jump in yet, start by reviewing [pull requests](../../pulls). Please don't sign off unless you've reviewed, understand, and agree with every change. If you'd like to contribute PR feedback without signing off, add comments without approving. These reviews are just as valuable as sign-off reviews because they help improve the overall quality!

When possible, try to suggest code changes using **Add a suggestion** to streamline the review process.

## 👩‍💻 Making code changes

If you want to contribute code changes, but aren't sure where to start, scan through [existing issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to find one that interests you. Use `labels` to narrow down your search.

If you find an issue that's assigned to someone, add a comment to check their status – there's a chance they may not have started yet. If you find an issue that isn't assigned, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
